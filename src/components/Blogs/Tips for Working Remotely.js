        <h3>Set a Routine</h3>
        <p>I have found this to be one of the most important things to do when working remotely. A routine will help you get into a rhythm and stay productive throughout the day. If your morning routine includes a shower, breakfast, and a commute to work, it can be helpful to make sure you still wake up at a similar time, shower, and make breakfast. Getting you mind ready for the day will help make the days more productive. </p>
        <h3>Set Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Boundaries are a must when it comes to working remotely. Both physical and mental boundaries can be key to having a productive day. Having a place to work remotely can make a huge difference. Sure it sounds like a great idea to work on the couch in your pjs, however for most people that is just not an effective way to get stuff done. I personally have a desk in a spare room that we have in our house. This helps me separate work from home while not actually leaving the house. When I am in that room I am working. I am not watching TV, doing projects around the house, or anything else that is not work related. This also helps set a mental boundary of when it is work time and when it is not work time. Besides the mental boundaries, it also provides a physical boundary for anyone else that may be in your house. Setting boundaries can be the difference between getting your projects done and wasting the day away. </p>
        <h3>Communication is Key</h3>
        <p>This can be one of the biggest hurdles someone will have to overcome when working remotely. In my particular working situation, we have the majority of our meetings using either Microsoft Teams or WebEx so communicating in meetings hasn’t changed much. However, I am fortunate enough to work on a team where the culture includes the willingness to always lend a hand or talk it out with a coworker when needed. Many people including myself are used to just walking over to a coworker’s desk for a quick question or to touch base on a project or task. This is now where the communication becomes more difficult. When I first started working remotely, I found that it was very easy to not have the small touch base meetings and to not reach out to coworkers when I am stuck or just need to talk something through. I had a feeling like I would be a bother by making them jump on a call. However, I found this to be quite the opposite. Many of my teammates are more than willing to spin up a screen share and help. This helps us keep in touch and make the situation a little bit normal.</p>
        <h3>Take Breaks</h3>
        <p>The piece of advice I have to offer for working remotely is to take breaks. This may sound like an odd piece of advice, but it is a necessary one for people who don’t normally work remotely. When I first began working remotely, I would try to not take any breaks away from my computer to make sure I was being as productive as possible. I personally found that I was actually less productive because I was trying so hard to not get distracted. I then thought about how many times each day I would have a random conversation with a coworker about sports or what was on tv last night. Sometimes while in the office I even make a point to walk to the other end of the building to fill up my water bottle just so I can step away from my desk for a few minutes. After thinking about those aspects of being in the office I then realized that I needed to take small breaks while working remotely. Sometimes I go for a walk around the block, get a drink of water, or text my friends and coworkers about those same topics we would discuss while in the office. Taking small breaks has definitely increased my productivity to the point where I am just as productive or sometimes even more productive than I was while working in the office.  While these are just a few tips for successfully working remotely, they are the few that I have found to be most important in determining the level of productivity I was able to have. If you have any questions or other tips please feel free to reach out and share.</p>
